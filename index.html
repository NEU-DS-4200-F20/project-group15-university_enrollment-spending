/********************** TASKS TO BE COMPLETED *************************/

The violin x-axis labels need to be a little bigger

The legend needs to be above the violin plots, not below. FML.
Better yet, add a legend to one side of the FTE line graph.

Add checkboxes to add/remove schools
  which will allow us to add more schools [show a max of 8 at once?]
Can the legend and the checkboxes be the same thing?
  a legend with checkboxes?
If no checkboxes, can brushing and linking be used in the legend?
  if so, can we brush multiple noncontiguous areas?
  i.e. Legend has 20 schools, brush up to 8 you want to graph?

Mouseover works, but the popups won't go away.
Also, after hovering the dot fills in purple.
After moving to a new dot, the old one stays purple (doesn't revert back to white)
  Nees a dollar sign.
  Popup info needs to be changed? Currently it shows the school name and TotalFTE.
  Kurt said he would love to see this:

      Actual $ amount: $xxx,xxx
      Per FTE Student:   $x,xxx
      Pct of Expenses:    xx.x%

Add functionality to switch chart data from 'Dollars per FTE' to 'Percent of Expenses'

    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    <p>These visualizations explore the spending patterns of post-secondary institutions and their impacts on
      enrollment. This work provides the visualizations necessary to compare spending patterns that lead to higher
      enrollments across comparable institutions. These visualizations could be used to compare different spending
      patterns of multiple universities and visually deduce statistically significant spending variations. Proper
      guidance can then be given to the universities that are not following spending patterns that lead to higher
      enrollment.</p>

    <h1>Visualizations</h1>
    <p>The violin plots show the distribution of the data for each of the key five spending categories, as a percentage
      of each school's total spending. The colored dots represent the actual data values, with each color representing a
      different school (see the legend below the line charts). Below are line graphs which show the each school's
      spending trends over time. Brushing on any of the points on the right side of a violin will filter the
      corresponding line graph to only show the data related to those data points.</p>

      <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
      <p>The first visualization, a violin plot, addresses the end-user's most important goals by allowing the user to
        explore the data from the comparison schools in several spending categories by generating violin plots that show
        the distribution of the values. This helps the user visualize areas of spending that are different to assess for
        statistical significance and possibly provide insight into where spending should be redirected. The height of
        each violin represents the range of the values, measured in standard deviations away from the mean. The width of
        the violin represents the frequency of the different values found in the data for this financial category.
        Hovering over any individual violin will provides details on demand to the user about the institution, year, and
        actual value of the datapoint.</p>
      <p>The next visualizations, line graphs, are interactive based on the user's interactions with any violin plot.
        The line graphs show time-series data for any institution's data that contributed to the generation of the
        violin. The institutions displayed will correlate with the datapoints represented in that portion of the violin.
        The data displayed shows the dollar amounts spent annually per Total Full-Time Enrollment hour. This is a
        powerful metric giving the user the ability to make direct comparisons regardless of total budget size. The
        datapoints highlighted in the violin plots will also be highlighted in the line graphs to identify trends over
        time.</p>
      <p>These capabilities will allow the end user to explore the dataset, discovering useful insights, and directing
        their research and in-depth statistical analysis. Depending on those findings it can possible to identify
        potential cost savings, and convince decision-makers in affecting financial policy changes.</p>
