    <h1>Abstract</h1>

    <p>This visualization explores the spending patterns of post-secondary institutions and their impacts on enrollment. This work provides the visualizations necessary to compare spending patterns that lead to higher enrollments across comparable institutions. These visualizations could be used to compare different spending patterns of multiple universities and visually deduce statistically significant spending variations. Proper guidance can then be given to the universities that are not following spending patterns that lead to higher enrollment.</p>


    <h1>Visualization</h1>

    <p>Include the interactive visualization as part of this page. Static example follows.</p>

    <h1>Demo Video</h1>

    <p>Embed an MP4 demo video using the HTML5 &lt;video&gt; tag. For example, this screen recording Prof. Cody Dunne made of Mike Bostock's flexible transitions in D3 slide:</p>

    <video controls width='100%'>
      <source src='http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cody/courses/shared/d3-flexible-transitions.mp4' type='video/mp4'>
      <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>

    <p>These visualizations address several of the end-user's goals. The correlation heatmaps identify potential areas of spending that correlate with changes in enrollment, prompting the user to consider a deeper analysis. The first of the three heatmaps aggregates the changes in spending and calculates the correlation between the average of the basket universities' change in enrollments. The the single comparison institution is not included in this heatmap, as the purpose of this visualization is to identify similar trends in the basket of comparable schools. The second heatmap compares the spending patterns of the single comparison institution to the spending patterns of the basket schools to explore possible areas of significant difference. Finally, the third heatmap shows correlation between enrollments and the financial categories of each of the basket schools individually. This provides more detail, allowing a direct comparison of spending and revenue from school to school.</p>
    <p>The third heatmap also has the functionality of brushing and linking, allowing the user to take a closer look at the statistical significance of the correlation results by generating violin plots that show the distribution of the datapoints in the selected heatmap cells. This helps the user visualize areas of spending that are different to assess for statistical significance and possibly provide insight into where spending should be redirected. The height of each violin represents the range of the values, measured in standard deviations away from the mean. The width of the violin represents the frequency of the different values found in the data for this financial category. Hovering over any individual violin provides details on demand to the user in the form of a bar graph.</p>
    <p>The final visualization is the bar graph generated by the user interacting with any violin plot. The bar graphs show time-series data for any institution's data that contributed to the generation of the violin. The institution displayed will correlate with the datapoint represented in that portion of the violin. The data displayed shows the dollar amounts spent annually per Total Full-Time Enrollment hour. This is a powerful metric giving the user the ability to make direct comparisons regardless of total budget size.
    <p>These capabilities will allow the end user to explore the dataset, discovering useful insights, and directing their research and in-depth statistical analysis. Depending on those findings it can possible to identify potential cost savings, and convince decision-makers in affecting financial policy changes.</p>
