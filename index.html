	Graphs
Make graph text not-selectable (axis labels)
Add $ or % to y-axis labels

	Legend
Filtering schools in the legend is great, but there is no way to reset the selections
without manually clicking each color again or reloading the page. Can this be fixed?

Kurt's first request was to be able to have more schools in the analysis. Like 25 of them.
I think this would require the use of multiple data files and allow switching in the fly.
Can either of you think of a good way to implement this? If so, I can easily build the
data files, each holding a basket of SSU plus 6-8 other schools. This would happen by the
user's selection determining the filename applied in visualization.js line 8. Thoughts?

Kurt said he would love to have functionality to switch chart data from 'Dollars per FTE
Student' to 'Percent of Expenses'. I imagine this would work in a similar way. We have two
column lists (one is percent, the other is FTE) and the user can select which one they want.
Actually, one option would be to use all the slabels and the other option would be to use
all the dlabels. See visualization.js lines 13 thru 79. Thoughts?

		<h1>Abstract</h1>
		<p>
			Our service partner is the Sustainable Path Forward Task Force from Salem State University (SSU), which has been charged with making recommendations for increasing revenue and reducing expenses. Their goal is to reallocate spending in areas that drive enrollments (increasing revenue) and decrease spending in areas that do not drive enrollments (reducing expenses). The following visualizations explore the spending patterns of post-secondary institutions to search for patterns and explore their impacts on enrollment. This work provides the visualizations necessary to compare spending patterns between similar schools to find spending patterns that may lead to higher enrollments. If patterns are found in these visualizations, the task force can focus their efforts on a deeper statistical analysis of the underlying data to determine if these patterns are statistically significant. Proper guidance can then be given to advise the school board on possible policy changes to the school's financial expenditures.
		</p>

		<h1>Visualizations</h1>
		<p>
			Our partner has identified eight schools which are similar to Salem State University and would be appropriate for comparison based on region (Massachusetts), sector (four-year public institutions) and size (more than 1,000 but less than 15,000 students).
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Bridgewater State University</li>
			<li>Fitchburg State University</li>
			<li>Framingham State University</li>
			<li>Westfield State University</li>
			<li>Worcester State University</li>
			<li>University of Massachusetts: Boston</li>
			<li>University of Massachusetts: Dartmouth</li>
			<li>University of Massachusetts: Lowell</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The data for the three University of Massachusetts schools has been averaged and is represented as one entity (gray). The averages of the MA State Schools, excluding SSU, is also displayed (pink), and finally, the averages of all schools other than SSU is displayed (light blue).
		</p>
		<p>
			The task force expressed they would like to be able to see the rate of growth of enrollments expressed as the number of Full-Time Equivalent Students, distribution of spending as a percentage of total spending, and time-series information showing the year over year differences in spending calculated per Full-Time Equivalent Student. This has been accomplished with the use of a line graph to show time-series enrollment data, a violin plot to show the distribution of spending in eight major categories, and individual line graphs to show the time-series detail of sending in each of those eight categories. In each of the line graphs, tooltips have been implemented to provide additional details on demand for any particular data point when hovering over that point with the pointer.

			<h3>Enrollment Trends:</h3>
			<p>
				The adjacent line graph shows each school's reported Full Time Equivalent (FTE) Students, which is a measurement equivalent to one student enrolled full time for one academic year. This is the best way to measure enrollments when making comparisons between universities, as it captures full-time, part-time, and partial-year enrollments by calculating, based on the aggregate total number of credit hours, how many students would have attended if they were all enrolled full-time for an entire academic year.
			</p>
			<p>
				We can see with this visualization that, on average, MA public schools (light blue) have reported positive growth over time, but Salem State University (purple) has shown steady negative growth since 2010. Bridgewater State (red) has the most FTE Students of the MA State schools, and the UMass schools (gray) have the highest average enrollment among all MA public schools. Both schools have reported steady growth over the timeframe. Since these schools seem to be getting it right, we would look for similar spending patterns between these schools to find a correlation between certain expenses and increasing enrollments.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this line graph, hovering over any point in the graph will reveal more data about that specific point. Below the line graph, click any colored dot in the legend to filter down to show only selected schools. Continue clicking schools to add or remove them from the visualizations.

			<h3>Spending Trends:</h3>
			<h4>Distribution</h4>
			<p>
				In the visualization to the right, a violin plot addresses an important concern of the end-user by showing the distribution of the data from SSU and the comparison schools in each of the eight expense categories as a percentage of each school's total spending. This allows the user to visualize each area of spending to determine the range of spending and help assess for statistical significance. The colored dots each represent one data point, the percent of the total budget spent per category in a particular year. Each color represents a different school (use the legend above the violin plots). The violin body gives a visual representation of how the data is distributed, and can be read similar to a sideways histogram. The height of each violin body represents the range of the values. The width of each violin body represents the frequency of the values found in the data for this financial category, with many values in a narrow range resulting in a wide violin body. Any group of data points outside of the main body of data should be investigated for correlation with increases or decreases in enrollment.
			</p>
			<h4>Time-series</h4>
			<p>
				The line graphs below show each school's spending trends per category over time. Each graph corresponds with one violin from the violin plots, with the first line graph representing the same data as the far left violin, and the last line graph representing the same data as the far right violin. The data displayed are the dollar amounts spent annually per Full-Time Equivalent Student. This is a powerful metric giving the user the ability to make direct comparisons regardless of the number of students or total budget size.
			</p>
			<p>
				The data displayed in these line graphs are dynamic based on the user's interactions with its corresponding violin plot or with the legend. Brushing on any of the points on the left side of a violin will filter the corresponding line graph to only show the data related to those data points. If the brushed points happen to represent Salem State in 2006 and Fitchburg State in 2010, the line graph will show the lines for both Salem and Fitchburg in both 2006 and 2010. It is recommended to only brush one violin at a time, but one can consecutively brush numerous violins to allow each line graph to highlight a different subset of the data.

		</p>
		<p>
			These capabilities will allow the end user to explore the dataset and hopefully discover useful insights. While an in-depth statistical analysis will be required to determine if the findings are significant, and beyond the scope of this project, we hope this tool will help users direct the focus of their research. Depending on those findings it can possible to identify which expenses help boost enrollment, which expenses should be reduced, and ultimately convince decision-makers in affecting financial policy changes.
