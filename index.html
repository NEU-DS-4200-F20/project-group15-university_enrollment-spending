		<h1>Abstract</h1>
		<p>
			Our service partner is the Sustainable Path Forward Task Force from Salem State University (SSU), which has
			been charged with making recommendations for increasing revenue and reducing expenses. Their goal is to
			reallocate spending in areas that drive enrollments (increasing revenue) and decrease spending in areas that
			do not drive enrollments (reducing expenses). The following visualizations explore the spending patterns of
			post-secondary institutions to search for patterns and explore their impacts on enrollment. This work
			provides the visualizations necessary to compare spending patterns between similar schools to find spending
			patterns that may lead to higher enrollments. If patterns are found in these visualizations, the task force
			can focus their efforts on a deeper analysis of the underlying data to determine if these
			patterns are statistically significant. Proper guidance can then be given to advise the school board on
			possible policy changes to the school's financial expenditures.
		</p>

		<h1>Visualizations</h1>
		<p>
			Our partner has identified eight schools which are similar to Salem State University and would be
			appropriate for comparison based on region (Massachusetts), sector (four-year public institutions),
			and size (more than 1,000 but less than 15,000 students).
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Bridgewater State University</li>
			<li>Fitchburg State University</li>
			<li>Framingham State University</li>
			<li>Westfield State University</li>
			<li>Worcester State University</li>
			<li>University of Massachusetts: Boston</li>
			<li>University of Massachusetts: Dartmouth</li>
			<li>University of Massachusetts: Lowell</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The data for the three University of Massachusetts schools have been averaged and is represented as one
			entity (gray). The average of the MA State Schools, excluding SSU, is also displayed (pink).
		</p>
		<!-- insert data file switcher here -->

		<p>
			The task force expressed they would like to be able to see the rate of growth of enrollments expressed
			as the number of Full-Time Equivalent Students, distribution of spending as a percentage of total
			spending, and time-series information showing the year over year differences in spending calculated
			per Full-Time Equivalent Student. This has been accomplished with the use of a line graph to show
			time-series enrollment data, a violin plot to show the distribution of spending in eight major
			categories, and individual line graphs to show the time-series detail of sending in each of those
			eight categories. In each of the line graphs, additional details are displayed when hovering over
			any point with the pointer. Hover over any &#9432; icon for additional suggestions.

			<h3>Enrollment Trends:</h3>
			<p>
				The adjacent line graph shows each nhe number of Full Time Equivalent (FTE) Students reported by
				each school, which is a measurement equivalent to one student enrolled full time for one academic
				year. This is the best way to measure enrollments when making comparisons between universities, as
				it captures full-time, part-time, and partial-year enrollments by calculating, based on the
				aggregate total number of credit hours, how many students would have attended if they were all
				enrolled full-time for an entire academic year.
				<!-- a tooltip activated by hovering over an icon -->
				<span class="tooltipicon"> &#9432;
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						We can see with this visualization that most of the schools in this analysis have reported
						positive growth over time, but Salem State University (purple) has shown steady negative
						growth since 2010. Bridgewater State (red) has the most FTE Students of the MA State schools,
						and the UMass schools (gray) have the highest average enrollment among all MA public schools.
						Both schools have reported steady growth over the timeframe.<br /><br />Since these schools seem to be
						getting it right, we would look for similar spending patterns between these schools to find
						a correlation between certain expenses and enrollment changes.
					</span>
				</span>
			</p>

			<h3>Spending Trends:</h3>
			<h4>Distribution of data</h4>
			<p>
				Below the legend, the violin plots show the distribution of the data from all the schools in each of
				the eight major expense categories. Each colored dot represents one school's spending in that category
				for a particular year, as a percent of their total budget. The gray violin body gives an alternate
				representation of the distribution, read similar to a sideways histogram. The height of each violin
				body represents the range of the values. The width of each violin body represents the frequency of the
				values, with many values in a narrow range resulting in a wide violin body. Any group of data points
				outside of the main body of data should be investigated for correlation with changes in enrollment.
			</p>
			<h4>Time-series data</h4>
			<p>
				Below, the line graphs show each school's spending trends per category over time. Each graph
				corresponds with one violin from the violin plots, with the top line graph representing the same
				data as the far left violin, and the bottom line graph representing the same data as the far right
				violin. The data displayed are the dollar amounts spent annually per Full-Time Equivalent Student.
				This is a powerful metric allowing for direct comparisons regardless of the number of students or
				total budget size.

		<!-- Begin Conclusion -->
		<h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
		<p>
			These capabilities will allow the end user to explore the dataset and hopefully discover useful insights.
			While an in-depth analysis will be required to determine if the findings are statistically significant, and
			is beyond the scope of this project, we hope this tool will help users direct the focus of their research.
			Depending on those findings it can possible to identify which expenses help boost enrollment, which
			expenses should be reduced, and ultimately convince decision-makers in affecting financial policy changes.
