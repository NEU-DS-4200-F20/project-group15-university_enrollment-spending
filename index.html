		<h1>Abstract</h1>
		<p>
			Our service partner is the Sustainable Path Forward Task Force from Salem State University (SSU), which has
			been charged with making recommendations for increasing revenue and reducing expenses. Their goal is to
			reallocate spending in areas that drive enrollments (increasing revenue) and decrease spending in areas that
			do not drive enrollments (reducing expenses). The following visualizations explore the spending patterns of
			post-secondary institutions to search for patterns that may reveal their impacts on enrollment. If patterns
			are found in these visualizations, a deeper analysis of the underlying data can determine if they  are
			statistically significant. Proper guidance can then be given to make fiscal policy changes that will boost
			enrollments.
		</p>

		<h1>Visualizations</h1>
		<p>
			We have included data from following basket of nine schools, as they are appropriate for comparison based
			on region (Massachusetts), sector (four-year public institutions), and size (1,000 to 15,000 students).
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Bridgewater State University</li>
			<li>Fitchburg State University</li>
			<li>Framingham State University</li>
			<li>Salem State University</li>
			<li>Westfield State University</li>
			<li>Worcester State University</li>
			<li>University of Massachusetts: Boston</li>
			<li>University of Massachusetts: Dartmouth</li>
			<li>University of Massachusetts: Lowell</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The data for the three University of Massachusetts schools have been averaged and is represented as one
			entity (gray). The University of Massachusetts: Amherst, Medical School, and Law School have been
			intentionally omitted from this basket. The average of the MA State Schools is also displayed (pink).
		</p>

		<p>
			The task force expressed they would like to be able to see the rate of growth of enrollments expressed
			as the number of Full-Time Equivalent Students, distribution of spending as a percentage of total
			spending, and time-series information showing the year over year differences in spending calculated
			per Full-Time Equivalent Student. This has been accomplished with the use of a line graph to show
			time-series enrollment data, a violin plot to show the distribution of spending in eight major
			categories, and individual line graphs to show the time-series detail of sending in each of those
			eight categories.
		</p>
		<p>
			In each of the line graphs, additional details are displayed when hovering over
			any data point. Hover over any &#9432; icon for additional suggestions.

			<h3>Enrollment Trends:</h3>
			<p>
				The adjacent line graph shows the number of Full Time Equivalent (FTE) Students reported by
				each school, which is a measurement equivalent to one student enrolled full time for one academic
				year. This is the best way to measure enrollments when making comparisons between universities, as
				it captures full-time, part-time, and partial-year enrollments by calculating, based on the
				aggregate total number of credit hours, and allows for direct comparisons regardless of school
				size or total budget.
				<!-- a tooltip activated by hovering over an icon -->
				<span class="tooltipicon"> &#9432;
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						We can see with this visualization that most of the schools in this analysis have reported
						positive growth over time, but Salem State University (purple) has shown steady negative
						growth since 2010. Bridgewater State (red) has the most FTE Students of the MA State schools,
						and the UMass schools (gray) have the highest average enrollment among all MA public schools.
						Both schools have reported steady growth over the timeframe.<br /><br />Since these schools
						seem to be getting it right, we would look for similar spending patterns between these
						schools to find a correlation between certain expenses and enrollment changes.

			<h3>Spending Trends:</h3>
			<h4>Distribution of data</h4>
			<p>
				Below the legend, violin plots show the distribution of all the data in each expense category. Each
				colored dot represents a school's spending for a particular year, as a percent of their total budget.
				A gray violin body gives an alternate representation of the distribution, read similar to a sideways
				histogram. The height of each violin represents the range of the values. The width of each violin
				represents the frequency of the values. This provides an overview to capture the variance of
				spending in each category.
			</p>
			<h4>Time-series data</h4>
			<p>
				Below, the line graphs show each school's spending trends, with each expense category isolated to a
				single chart. Each line graph corresponds with one violin. The top line graph represents the same data
				as the far left violin. The bottom line graph represents the same data as the far right violin. The data
				displayed are the dollar amounts spent annually per FTE student. This provides a direct comparison
				between schools, and unlike percentages, is not affected by changes in other categories.

		<!-- Begin Conclusion -->
		<h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
		<p>
			These capabilities will allow the end user to explore the dataset and hopefully discover useful insights.
			While an in-depth analysis will be required to determine if the findings are statistically significant, and
			is beyond the scope of this project, we hope this tool will help users direct the focus of their research.
			Depending on those findings it can possible to identify which expenses help boost enrollment, which
			expenses should be reduced, and ultimately convince decision-makers in affecting financial policy changes.
		</p>

		<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>
		<p>
			I would like to thank everyone who helped make this possible: Dr. Kurt von Seekamm from Salem State
			University, for your unwavering guidance and comical support; Kyle Langford, for your technical advice
			and honest critiques; Professor Cody Dunne, for putting things into perspective; And especially Leanne,
			for making me fix my grammar errors, waiting patiently to eat dinner, and warming up my cold feet when
			I climbed into bed at 3am.
